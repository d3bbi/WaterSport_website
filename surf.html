            <h2>Why practice windsurf in Malta?</h2>
            <p>Malta is the ideal place for windsurfing due to the warm waters and the easy accessibility of windsurfing spots. Windsurfing is a form of sailing, whereby you stand on a board attached to a sail and you move across the water, through the force
                of the wind. On the other hand surfing depends on the waves, whereby you stand on a surfing board and ride the waves. The best time to go windsurfing in Malta is between November and March, when the wind conditions are the best.
